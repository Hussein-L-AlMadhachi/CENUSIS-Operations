Academic Operations Information System
======================================

Project Overview
----------------
The Academic Operations Information System is a comprehensive backend solution designed to streamline
and digitize the core academic processes of a university. It serves as a central hub for managing
students, teaching staff, subjects, and the complex web of academic records that connects them. including 
but not limited to coursework grades and attendance Built with a focus on data integrity and efficient
administration, the system supports various user roles including Administrators, Super Admins, and Teachers.

Key Features
------------

1. Student Administration
   - **Profile Management**: Maintains detailed records for each student, including personal information, enrollment year, degree program, and current class level.
   - **Academic Tracking**: Monitors student progress by tracking years retaken and years failed, providing a clear view of academic standing.
   - **Search & Organization**: Offers robust tools to search for students by name (with fuzzy search capabilities) and filter them by degree or class.

2. Course & Subject Management
   - **Curriculum Definition**: Allows for the creation and management of subjects, specifying critical details such as total hours, weekly hours, semester placement, and attendance requirements.
   - **Teacher Assignment**: Links subjects to specific teaching staff, ensuring clear accountability for course delivery.
   - **Classification**: Organizes subjects based on degree programs and class levels.

4. Teaching Staff Management
   - **Staff Profiles**: Manages profiles for professors and teachers.
   - **Administrative Control**: Provides administrators with tools to register new staff, update profiles, and manage system access.

5. Security & Access Control
   - **Role-Based Access**: distinct privileges for Super Admins, Admins, and Teachers to ensure data security and operational integrity.
   - **Authentication**: Secure login and session management for all users.

Technical Architecture
----------------------
- **Backend Framework**: Node.js with Express, providing a robust and scalable server environment.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, leveraged for its reliability and relational data integrity, utilizing `pg-norm` for efficient database interactions.
- **API Communication**: Implements a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) architecture using `enders-sync`, ensuring type-safe and efficient communication between the client and server.
- **Language**: Written in TypeScript, ensuring code quality and maintainability through strong typing.
